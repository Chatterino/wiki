Chatterino integrates with a bunch of third party services to provide extended functionality for you.

## BetterTTV

For Twitch channels, we load emotes from [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/).

BetterTTV provides [global emotes](https://betterttv.com/emotes/global) that are available in every channel. These can be disabled with the "Show BTTV global emotes" setting.

BetterTTV provides [channel-specific emotes](https://betterttv.com/emotes/shared). What emotes are loaded is up to the owner of the channel you're in. These can be disabled with the "Show BTTV channel emotes" setting.

## FrankerFaceZ

For Twitch channels, we load emotes from [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/).

FrankerFaceZ provides [global emotes](https://www.frankerfacez.com/channel/__ffz_global) that are available in every channel. These can be disabled with the "Show FFZ global emotes" setting.

FrankerFaceZ provides [channel-specific emotes](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticons/). What emotes are loaded is up to the owner of the channel you're in. These can be disabled with the "Show FFZ channel emotes" setting.

## 7TV

For Twitch channels, we load emotes from [7TV](https://7tv.app/).

7TV provides [global emotes](https://7tv.app/emote-sets/62cdd34e72a832540de95857) that are available in every channel. These can be disabled with the "Show 7TV global emotes" setting.

7TV provides the ability to use unlisted emotes. You can read more about them [here](TODO). By default, Chatterino will not display these emotes even if they're added to a Channel. You can modify this behaviour with the "Show unlisted 7TV emotes" setting.
