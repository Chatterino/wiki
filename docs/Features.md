We support Twitch's [Chat Replies](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/chat-basics?language=en_US#replies) feature.[^1]

A reply can be executed by right-clicking a message, and selecting `Reply to message`, or by opening an existing Reply Thread and sending your message there.  
Users who replied to your message, or messages sent in a reply thread you participated in, are highlighted and can be customized in the highlight setting `Participated Reply Threads`.
