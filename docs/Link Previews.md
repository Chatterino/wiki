# Link Previews

Link Previews make it easy to check what's behind a link without visiting the link in the browser.
All links go through [github.com/chatterino/api](https://github.com/chatterino/api) to protect your IP from any leaks.

Optionally also turn on thumbnails in your preferred size for an even richer link experience.
