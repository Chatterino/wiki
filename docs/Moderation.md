## Logging

Users are able to log all the channels they are in using the logging feature. This writes the messages to a text file with date and time. You can choose a timestamp format or none, log only selected channels from a list, and have each channel logged to separate files.

## Moderation Mode

Moderation mode is enabled by clicking ![ModModeDisabled](./images/moderation/modModeDisabled.png){: width=18; height=18 } in a channel that you moderate. Available variables are `{user.name}`, `{msg.id}`, `{msg.text}` & `{channel.name}`. Below is a list of examples that can be used:

| Function                 | Action                                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ban a user               | `/ban {user.name}`                                                   |
| Unban a user             | `/unban {user.name}`                                                 |
| Timeout a user           | `/timeout {user.name} 600`                                           |
| Delete a user's message  | `/delete {msg.id}`                                                   |
| pajbot2 report           | `/w botname #{channel.name} !report {user.name} being rude`          |
| pajbot2 longreport       | `/w botname #{channel.name} !longreport {user.name} being very rude` |
| Open the user's usercard | `/user {user.name}`                                                  |
| pajbot banphrase         | `/w botname !add banphrase {msg.text}`                               |
