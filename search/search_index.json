If a message starts with the \"trigger\" then the message will be replaced with the Command. Example Add Command Hello chat :) with the trigger /hello . Now typing /hello in chat will send Hello chat :) instead of /hello . Advanced The trigger has to be matched at the start of the message but there is a setting to also match them at the end . Triggers don't need to start with / Using placeholders {1} , {2} , {3} and so on can be used to insert the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... word after the trigger. Example: Add Command /timeout {1} 1 with trigger /warn . Now typing /warn user123 will send /timeout user123 1 Similarly {1+} and so on can be used to insert all words starting with the 1st, ... word. Example: Add Command Have a {1+} day! with trigger /day . Now typing /day very super nice will send Have a very super nice day! You can use {{1} if you want to send {1} literally.","title":"Commands"},{"location":"Commands/#example","text":"Add Command Hello chat :) with the trigger /hello .

For example the regex ab?c would match abc or ac , but not abbc or 123 . In Chatterino, you can use them to highlight messages (and more) based on complex conditions. Basic patterns: Pattern Matches x? nothing or x x* x , repeated any number of times x+ x , repeated any number of times but at least 1 ^ The start of the text $ The end of the text x\\|y x or y You can group multiple statements with () : Pattern Matches asd? asd or as (asd)? asd or nothing \\(asd\\) (asd) , literally You can also group multiple characters with [] : Pattern Matches [xyz] x , y or z [1-5a-f] 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , a , b , c , d , e , f [^abc] Anything, except a , b and c [\\-] - , literally (escaped with \\ ) \\[xyz\\] [xyz] , literally Special patterns: Pattern Matches \\d Digit characters (0-9) \\D Non-digit characters \\w Word characters (a-zA-Z0-9_) \\W Non-word characters \\s Spaces, tabs, etc. \\S Not spaces, tabs, etc. \\b Word boundaries (between \\w and \\W) \\B Non-word boundaries You can try out your regex pattern on websites like regex101","title":"Regex"}]}
