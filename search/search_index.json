If a message starts with the \"trigger\" then the message will be replaced with the Command. Built-in commands \u00b6 Chatterino comes with a collection of built-in commands to help with channel management, Twitch interaction, and other misc. features. /block & /unblock \u00b6 Usage: /(block|unblock) <user> Blocks or unblocks the specified user. Blocking will hide that user's messages/whispers as well as disassociate them from you on Twitch. For more information about blocking, see Twitch's help article . /chatters \u00b6 Usage: /chatters Shows the total amount of chatters currently connected to the channel. /clearmessages \u00b6 Usage: /clearmessages Clears all messages from the current split/channel. This command is purely visual and is not related to the /clear moderator command. /clip \u00b6 Usage: /clip Creates a clip from the last 30 seconds of the current channel. Also provides an edit link to edit a clip from the current point in time. /debug-args \u00b6 Usage: /debug-args Displays the arguments that chatterino was launched with. /delete \u00b6 Usage: /delete <msg-id> Moderator only, deletes a message in chat with the provided ID. Usually used in mod actions as they can pass through the message ID. /fakemsg \u00b6 Usage: /fakemsg <raw message> Displays the provided IRC messsage in chat as if it was sent from Twitch's IRC server. /marker \u00b6 Usage: /marker Editor only, creates a stream marker in the current stream. Streamer must be live to create markers. /openurl \u00b6 Usage: /openurl <url> Opens a URL in the default web browser. Useful in custom commands. /popout \u00b6 Usage: /popout [channel] Opens the current channel or provided channel's chat in Twitch's popout webchat, using your default browser. /popup \u00b6 Usage: /popup [channel] Opens the current channel or provided channel's chat in a new window. /r \u00b6 Usage: /r <message> Replies to the last received whisper. /setgame \u00b6 Usage: /setgame <game> Broadcaster only, sets the current channel's game to the best match of the provided game name. /settitle \u00b6 Usage: /settitle <title> Broadcaster only, sets the current channel's title to the provided text. /streamlink \u00b6 Usage: /streamlink [channel] Attempts to open current or specified stream in streamlink. For more information, see Streamlink's website . /uptime \u00b6 Usage: /uptime Displays the uptime of the current channel's livestream. /user \u00b6 Usage: /user <user> [channel] Opens the specified user's Twitch usercard for the given channel (or the channel provided) in the default browser. /usercard \u00b6 Usage: /usercard <user> [channel] Opens the specified user's Chatterino usercard for the given channel or the channel provided. /w (Whisper) \u00b6 Usage: /w <user> <message> Whispers the provided text to a user on Twitch. See Chatterino's whisper FAQ item for whisper-related issues. Custom commands \u00b6 Example \u00b6 Add Command Hello chat :) with the trigger /hello . Now typing /hello in chat will send Hello chat :) instead of /hello . Advanced \u00b6 The trigger has to be matched at the start of the message but there is a setting to also match them at the end . Triggers don't need to start with / Using placeholders \u00b6 {1} , {2} , {3} and so on can be used to insert the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... word after the trigger. Example: Add Command /timeout {1} 1 with trigger /warn . Now typing /warn user123 will send /timeout user123 1 Similarly {1+} and so on can be used to insert all words starting with the 1st, ... word. Example: Add Command Have a {1+} day! with trigger /day . Now typing /day very super nice will send Have a very super nice day! You can use {{1} if you want to send {1} literally. {channel.name} can be used to insert the name of the current channel. Example: Add Command /openurl https://twitch.tv/{channel.name} with trigger /openchannel . Now typing /openchannel will open the current channel in your browser. {channel.id} can be used to insert the Twitch account ID of the owner of current channel. {my.name} can be used to insert the Twitch username of the currently selected account. {my.id} can be used to insert the Twitch account ID of the currently selected account. {stream.title} can be used to insert the title set in the current channel. Only works if the channel is live. Example: Add Command The title is {stream.title} with trigger /title . Now typing /title will send a message like The title is Programming.S04E74.1440p.MP4-XD.NVENC {stream.game} can be used to insert the game set in the current channel. Only works if the channel is live. Example: Add Command I'm currently playing {stream.game} with trigger /game . Now typing /game will send a message like I'm currently playing World of Warcraft .","title":"Commands"},{"location":"Commands/#commands","text":"Commands are used as shortcuts for long messages.

The goal is to teach programmers without C++ background (java/python/etc.), people who haven't used Qt or otherwise have different experience the idioms of the codebase. Thus, we will focus on those which are different from those other environments. There are extra guidelines available here , but they are considered as extras and not as important. Tooling \u00b6 Formatting \u00b6 Code is automatically formatted using clang-format . It takes the burden off of the programmer and ensures that all contributors use the same style (even if mess something up accidentally). We recommend that you set up automatic formatting on file save in your editor. Comments \u00b6 Comments should only be used to: Increase readability (e.g. grouping member variables). Containing information that can't be expressed in code. Try to structure your code so that comments are not required. Good example \u00b6 /// Result is 0 if a == b, negative if a < b and positive if b > a. /// ^^^ You can't know this from the function signature! // Even better: Return a \"strong ordering\" type. // (but we don't have such a type right now) int compare(const QString &a, const QString &b); Bad example \u00b6 /* * Matches a link and returns boost::none if it failed and a * QRegularExpressionMatch on success. * ^^^ This comment just repeats the function signature!!! * * @param text The text that will be checked if it contains a * link * ^^^ No need to repeat the obvious. */ boost::optional<QRegularExpressionMatch> matchLink(const QString &text); Code \u00b6 Arithmetic Types \u00b6 Arithmetic types (like char, short, int, long, float and double), bool, and pointers are NOT initialized by default in C++. They keep whatever value is already at their position in the memory. This makes debugging harder and is unpredictable, so we initialize them to zero by using {} after their name when declaring them. class ArithmeticTypes { int thisIs0{}; QWidget *thisIsNull{}; bool thisIsFalse_{}; // int a; // <- Initialized to \"random\" value. // QWidget *randomPtr. std::vector<int> myVec; // <- other types call constructors instead, so no need for {} // std::vector<int> myVec{}; <- pointless {} int thisIs5 = 5; // <- Also fine, we initialize it with another value. }; void myFunc() { int a = 1 + 1; // <- here we initialize it immediately, so it's fine. } Passing parameters \u00b6 The way a parameter is passed signals how it is going to be used inside of the function. C++ doesn't have multiple return values so there is \"out parameters\" (reference to a variable that is going to be assigned inside of the function) to simulate multiple return values. Cheap to copy types like int/enum/etc. can be passed in per value since copying them is fast. void setValue(int value) { // ... } References mean that the variable doesn't need to be copied when it is passed to a function. type meaning const Type& name in Parameter. It is NOT going to be modified and may be copied inside of the function. Type& name out or in+out Parameter. It will be modified. Pointers signal that objects are managed manually. While the above are only guaranteed to live as long as the function call (= don't store and use later) these may have more complex lifetimes. type meaning Type* name The lifetime of the parameter may exceed the length of the function call. It may use the QObject parent/children system. R-value references && work similar to regular references but signal the parameter should be \"consumed\". void storeLargeObject(LargeObject &&object) { // ... } void storeObject(std::unique_ptr<Object> &&object) { // ... } void main() { // initialize a large object (= will be expensive to copy) LargeObject large = // ... // Object accepts an r-value reference + we use std::move() // => We move the object = no need to copy. storeLargeObject(std::move(large)); // But even worse, you can't copy a unique_ptr so we need to move here! std::unique_ptr<Object> unique = // ... storeObject(std::move(unique)); // The pointer contained by unique has now been consumed by \"storeObject\" // so it just holds a null pointer now. assert(unique.get() == nullptr); } Generally the lowest level of requirement should be used e.g. passing Channel& instead of std::shared_ptr<Channel>& (aka ChannelPtr ) if possible. Members \u00b6 All functions names are in camelCase . Private member variables are in camelCase_ (note the underscore at the end). We don't use the get prefix for getters. We mark functions as const if applicable . class NamedObject { public: const QString &name() const; // <- no \"get\" prefix. void setName(const QString &name); bool hasLongName() const; // <- \"has\" or \"is\" prefix is okay static void myStaticFunction(); // <- also lowercase QString publicName; private: // Private variables have \"_\" suffix. QString name_; // QString name; <- collides with name() function }; void myFreeStandingFunction(); // <- also lower case Casts \u00b6 Avoid c-style casts: (type)variable . Instead use explicit type casts: type(variable) Or use one of static_cast , const_cast and dynamic_cast Try to avoid reinterpret_cast unless necessary. void example() { float f = 123.456; int i = (int)f; // <- don't int i = int(f); // <- do Base* base = // ... Derived* derived = (Derived*)base; // <- don't Derived* derived = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base); // <- do // Only use \"const_cast\" solved if using proper const correctness doesn't work. const int c = 123; ((int &)c) = 123; // <- don't const_cast<int &>(c) = 123; // <- do (but only sometimes) // \"reinterpret_cast\" is also only required in very rarely. int p = 123; float *pp = (float*)&p; float *pp = reinterpret_cast<float*>(&p); } This \u00b6 Always use this to refer to instance members to make it clear where we use either locals or members. class Test { void testFunc(int a); int testInt_{}; } Test::testFunc(int a) { // do this->testInt_ += 2; this->testFunc(); // don't testInt_ -= 123; testFunc(2); this->testFunc(testInt_ + 1); } Managing resources \u00b6 Regular classes \u00b6 Keep the element on the stack if possible. If you need a pointer or have complex ownership you should use one of these classes: - Use std::unique_ptr if the resource has a single owner. - Use std::shared_ptr if the resource has multiple owners. QObject classes \u00b6 Use the object tree to manage lifetime where possible. Objects are destroyed when their parent object is destroyed. If you have to explicitly delete an object use variable->deleteLater() instead of delete variable . This ensures that it will be deleted on the correct thread. If an object doesn't have a parent consider using std::unique_ptr<Type, DeleteLater> with DeleteLater from \"src/common/Common.hpp\". This will call deleteLater() on the pointer once it goes out of scope or the object is destroyed.","title":"Contribution Guidelines"},{"location":"Contributing%20for%20Developers/#contribution-guidelines","text":"This is a set of guidelines for contributing to Chatterino.

Filters are created in the Settings page and are applied by opening the Split menu (three dots) and selecting \"Set filters\". Applied filters are saved when you close and open Chatterino. Multiple filters can be applied to a Split. A message must pass all applied filters for it to be displayed. Simple filters are available through the Channel Filter Creator dialog. Advanced filters take inspiration from many programming languages, and the full description of keywords and operators can be found below. Example filters \u00b6 message.content contains \"hello\" Only messages that contain the phrase hello message.length < 40 || author.subbed Messages that are less than 40 characters log, OR are sent by a subscriber. channel.name == \"somestreamer\" && author.badges contains \"moderator\" Messages that originated in the channel somestreamer AND are from users with a moderator badge Filter syntax \u00b6 A filter must be a valid expression. An expression is comprised of conditions and values which are evaluated to a single True or False value to decide whether to filter a message. Evaluating to something other than True or False will lead to all messages being filtered out. Values \u00b6 A value can be an integer ( 123 , 5 ), a string ( \"hello\" , \"this is a string\" ), a variable ( author.name , message.length ), a list of values ( {123, \"hello\", author.name} ), or a regular expression ( r\"\\d\\d\\d\\d\" ). Lists are surrounded by braces ( {} ) and list items are separated by commas. A list item can be a value (e.g. \"hello\" ) or an expression wrapped in parentheses (e.g. (author.sub_length * message.length) ). Regular expressions are similar to strings, but are denoted with an r before the opening quotation mark (e.g. r\"something\" ). To make a regular expression case-insensitive, use ri before the opening quotation mark (e.g. ri\"something\" ). When a filter is evaluated, variables are replaced with the values they represent. Literals: Name Example Int 123 , 5 String \"Hello there\" , \"Escaped \\\" quote\" RegEx r\"\\d\\d\\d\\d\" , ri\"something.*\" List `{\"list item\", 123} Operators \u00b6 Binary operators act on two values: 1 + 2 author.subbed && flags.highlighted \"long sentence\" contains \"ten\" Unary operators act on one value: !author.subbed The following operators are available: Operator Description && And || Or ! Not == Equals != Not equals < Less than <= Less than or equal to > Greater than >= Greater than or equal to contains String, List, or Map contains startswith String or List starts with text or string, respectively endswith String or List ends with text or string, respectively match Match string with regular expression + Add (or string concatenation) - Subtract * Multiply / Divide (integer) % Modulus Variables \u00b6 The following variables are available: Variable Type Description Author User who sent the message author.badges List List of author's badges author.color Color* Color code of author, or none author.name String Display name of author author.no_color Bool Whether the author has no color set (i.e. gray name) author.subbed Bool Whether author is subscribed author.sub_length Int How long author has been subscribed (or zero) Channel The channel where the message was sent channel.name String Channel name channel.watching Bool Whether the channel is being watched (requires Chatterino extension) channel.live Bool Whether the channel is currently live Flags Message-specific flags flags.highlighted Bool Whether the message is highlighted flags.points_redeemed Bool Whether the message was redeemed through channel points flags.sub_message Bool Whether the message is a sub/resub/gift message flags.system_message Bool Whether the message is a system message (i.e. timeout/ban/info) flags.reward_message Bool Whether the message is a redeemed channel point reward message flags.first_message Bool Whether the message is the author's first message in the channel flags.elevated_message Bool Whether the message is a message the author paid to keep in browser chat for an increased duration 2 flags.whisper Bool Whether the message is a whisper flags.reply Bool Whether the message is a reply flags.automod Bool Whether the message has automod information or actions 1 Message Actual message sent message.content String Message content message.length Int Message length *Note: To compare a Color , compare it to a color hex code string: author.color == \"#FF0000\" Data types \u00b6 Generally, data types won't be much of an issue. However, mismatching data types can cause confusing results. For example: \"abc\" + 123 == \"abc123\" but 123 + \"abc\" != \"123abc\" 1 + \"2\" == 3 and 1 + \"2\" == \"3\" . Chatterino will try to transform incompatible types for operations, but it isn't always successful. If two types can't mix, False or 0 will be returned, depending on the context. Double check the table above to see the types of each variable to prevent unexpected results. Regular Expressions \u00b6 Chatterino can match string variables to a regular expression, returning whether the expression matched or, optionally, the value of a capture group. Simple matching \u00b6 \"some string\" match r\"some regex\" returns True or False . For example: message.content match r\"\\d\\d\" Group capturing \u00b6 \"some string\" match {r\"some regex\", capture number} returns False if no match or the value of the nth captured group. For example: message.content match {r\"(\\d\\d)/(\\d\\d)/(\\d\\d\\d\\d)\", 3} matches the year component of a date like 12/31/2020 . (message.content match {r\"(\\d\\d)/(\\d\\d)/(\\d\\d\\d\\d)\", 3}) == \"2020\" will filter only messages that contain a written date with 2020 as the year. About the order of operations \u00b6 The order of operations in filters may not be exactly what you expect. Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first Math operations are evaluated from left to right, not by MDAS. 2 + 3 * 4 yields 20 , not 14 . a && b || c && d is evaluated as (a && b) || (c && d) a || b && c || d is evaluated as a || (b && c) || d Basically, if you're unsure about the order of operations, use extra parentheses.

Check the below troubleshooting below corresponding to your operating system for assistance! Please search for your problem in the GitHub Issues . If there is no such issue, please create a new one . If you have more questions, feel free to join the Discord . Basic troubleshooting \u00b6 Prior to starting on the below, you should first try the basic troubleshooting steps listed here. These steps can resolve a variety of issues: Ensure that your Chatterino is up to date. [Windows] Try running Chatterino in administrator mode. [Windows] Ensure that you have the x64 Visual C++ Redistributables installed AND have restarted your PC after installation: x64: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe Chocolatey: choco install vcredist140 I am having an issue with the Chatterino extension \u00b6 Chatterino extension issues should be posted here . Chatterino not starting/Crashing upon startup \u00b6 [Windows] Try running Chatterino in administrator mode. [Windows] Adding Chatterino to your anti-virus/malware whitelist. [Windows] If nothing else works, try resetting your settings using the Fresh Install option in the installer. Does using Chatterino accumulate Twitch channel points? \u00b6 Unfortunately not. This is a limitation due to Twitch using internal APIs for channel points. This will however work with most chatbots, as they simply take you being connected to chat as \"watching the stream\". Can I use Chatterino as my chat overlay for my stream? \u00b6 You definitely can, but it's not recommended. We suggest using a service similar to KapChat . Why are my messages being sent in webchat, but not in Chatterino? \u00b6 There's a few things to cover here: If your message is not sent in Chatterino, it is likely not sent in webchat either. Webchat renders messages whether they are sent or not, Chatterino will only render the message if it is accepted by the server. If you're trying to type in a chat where there are a lot of active chatters, then your message may be dropped by Twitch's chat servers (due to the volume). If an alt account has been banned in that chat, you have likely been shadowbanned by Twitch in that channel. Which prevents any of your other accounts from speaking in that channel. If you have spammed too much in another chat, you have likely been temporarily shadowbanned by Twitch in channels where you are not: Subscribed, VIP or Moderator. If all else fails, you may be having connection issues to Twitch or your network may be blocking the necessary IRC ports in order to connect. Chatterino is repeatedly disconnecting from Twitch chat \u00b6 If you are having troubles with Chatterino repeatedly connecting/disconnecting, it is likely due to the large amount of channels you are connected to. The maximum channel limit is usually around the 100 mark, but may differ from user to user. Try closing splits in Chatterino in order to fix this. I am unable to send whispers from Chatterino \u00b6 If you are getting the Your settings prevent you from sending this whisper error message, it may be due to: You turning on the Block Whispers from Strangers option in your Twitch account security settings . Your account is too new to be able to whisper users using IRC. If you wish to whisper a user, you must have that user follow your channel, then use the Twitch website to whisper the user. This was an IRC spam protection measure put in place by Twitch. This is not a Chatterino bug. Starting in nightly 974a8f11 you are able to send whispers if you have a verified phone number attached to your Twitch account, this will allow you to bypass the previous limitation due to your account age. NOTE: Phone Number Authentication is NOT the same thing as Two-Factor Authentication. You can add a phone number to your account in Twitch Settings. Once you have added a phone number, you can toggle the setting Helix timegate /w behaviour to Always Use Helix FFZ/BTTV emotes are not working \u00b6 You need to be logged in to see emotes. Try hitting F5 once to manually refresh the emotes. Chatterino only makes a connection to the necessary APIs to fetch these emotes, if you are still having issues fetching them, then your network may be blocking requests to those APIs. I have link information turned on, but am unable to see the information when hovering over a link \u00b6 The server (braize) used to fetch the link information may be down. Braize uptime can be found here . Your network may be having issues connecting to braize. Try restarting your PC and router. How do I get the supporter badge? \u00b6 Donate \u20ac10 to fourtf here (can be done in multiple donations). You should get your badge automatically after about 5 minutes. Make sure to restart Chatterino if you can't see the badge. If you still can't see it, ask fourtf on Chatterino Discord for assistance. How do I disable the supporter badge? \u00b6 Log in to the badge manager and click on Disable My Chatterino Badge . Login expired error \u00b6 If you're getting the Login expired for user <user>! Try adding your account again. error, simply re-add your account and it will start working again. How do I add Chatterino as an OBS dock? \u00b6 This is not natively supported, but there is a workaround: Add a dock into OBS for standard Twitch chat. Turn on Always on top in Chatterino. Click the 3 dots up the top of a channel split and click Popup . Move and resize the chat to overlay on top of the standard Twitch chat. What is nightly and how to use / install it \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Nightly is a \"developer release\" of Chatterino. It is released every time there's a new change added to source code. It includes some features that may not be available in the latest stable release. Installation \u00b6 Go to nightly release page on GitHub. Download nightly: For Windows download chatterino-windows-x86-64.zip For Linux download Chatterino-x86_64.AppImage For Mac download chatterino-osx.dmg Install nightly: On Windows , right-click the archive > Extract All > Extract (Override files if prompted). Open the newly extracted folder and create a shortcut for the chatterino.exe file to the Desktop for easy access. On Linux , open up the download directory in your terminal and execute the following command chmod +x Chatterino-x86_64.AppImage && sudo mv Chatterino-x86_64.AppImage /usr/local/bin On Mac , open the dmg file and drag Chatterino into the Applications folder. Updating \u00b6 Nightly ignores version checking and it will not attempt to update on its own. Because of that it will not notify you when a new stable update is available. To update, repeat steps above. If you want to switch back to stable release, download and install it from Chatterino's website . Issues \u00b6 Since nightly is a testing release, it may be a little unstable. If you find any bugs, make sure to report an issue on GitHub . Before opening an issue make sure you're on latest nightly (to check it, go to Settings > About and compare commit hash) and that there's no duplicate issue already open. I see white borders on full screen \u00b6 This is a Windows issue, it can be mitigated by turning on Compatibility mode for Chatterino.
